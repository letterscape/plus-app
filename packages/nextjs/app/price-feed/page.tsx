                    Chainlink Data Feeds provide reliable, tamper-proof inputs for smart contracts, delivering off-chain
                    data such as asset prices directly to on-chain applications. The{" "}
                    <span className="font-bold">AggregatorV3Interface</span> is used to interact with these price feeds,
                    allowing your smart contracts to fetch the latest price data from a decentralized network of
                    oracles.

                      Start by importing the <span className="font-bold">AggregatorV3Interface</span> into your smart
                      contract. This interface allows you to easily integrate Chainlink price feeds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Declare a state variable of type <span className="font-bold">AggregatorV3Interface</span> to
                      represent the price feed in your smart contract.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Identify the correct price feed address for your desired asset pair and network from the{" "}

                        official Chainlink CCIP documentation.
                      </a>{" "}
                      . Use this address to initialize the price feed in your contract.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Use the <span className="font-bold">latestRoundData</span> function of the{" "}
                      <span className="font-bold">AggregatorV3Interface</span> to retrieve the most recent price, round
                      ID, timestamp, and other relevant data.

                      Price feeds are updated based on two conditions: either when the price changes significantly
                      beyond a defined threshold or after a specific time interval, ensuring that your application
                      always has access to the most accurate and timely data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The data returned from the price feed is denominated with a fixed number of decimals, which can
                      vary by feed. Ensure your contract handles these decimals correctly when performing calculations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For applications requiring multiple price feeds, consider using the{" "}
                      <span className="font-bold">FeedRegistry</span>, which provides a unified interface to access
                      multiple price feeds across different asset pairs and networks.
